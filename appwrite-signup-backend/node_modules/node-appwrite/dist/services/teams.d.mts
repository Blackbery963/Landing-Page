If initiated from a Server SDK, the new member will be added automatically to the team.

You only need to provide one of a user ID, email, or phone number. Appwrite will prioritize accepting the user ID &gt; email &gt; phone number if you provide more than one of these parameters.

Use the `url` parameter to redirect the user from the invitation email to your app. After the user is redirected, use the [Update Team Membership Status](https://appwrite.io/docs/references/cloud/client-web/teams#updateMembershipStatus) endpoint to allow the user to accept the invitation to the team.

Please note that to avoid a [Redirect Attack](https://github.com/OWASP/CheatSheetSeries/blob/master/cheatsheets/Unvalidated_Redirects_and_Forwards_Cheat_Sheet.md) Appwrite will accept the only redirect URLs under the domains you have added as a platform on the Appwrite Console.
